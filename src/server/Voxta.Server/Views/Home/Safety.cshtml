            <h3>1. Content & Age Restrictions</h3>
            <p>This AI companion is designed for adult use. All users must commit to abstaining from interactions involving depictions of minors.</p>

            <h3>2. Informed Consent</h3>
            <p>Remember, you're interacting with an AI, not a human. Depending on the AI service you're using, data may be collected to enhance AI performance. Refer to the respective AI service's data policy for more information.</p>

            <h3>3. AI Dependency</h3>
            <p>While this AI companion can provide interaction, it should not replace human relationships. It's not a sentient being. Human connection is important.</p>

            <h3>4. Emotional Safety</h3>
            <p>The AI encourages positive interactions and discourages harmful behavior. If you're experiencing serious emotional distress, the AI is not equipped to provide adequate help - professional help should be sought in these instances.</p>

            <h3>5. Privacy and Data Security</h3>
            <p>This application doesn't collect or store your data. However, the AI service you're using might. Please check their data policy for detailed information.</p>

            <h3>6. Ethics & Bias</h3>
            <p>The AI service you're using may unintentionally display biases due to the nature of its training data. This is a known issue in the field and is continuously being addressed by AI researchers and developers.</p>
