# Voxta

Voxta is a system that lets you speak with an AI in real time, using your preferred AI services.

## How to install the server

Download the latest release, extract it and run (not yet public) and run Voxta.Desktop.exe. This will launch the server and open the interface automatically.

You can also launch Voxta.Server.exe directly if you're comfortable with command line. In this case you need to open the interface in your browser at <http://127.0.0.1:5384/>.

## How to build from source

You'll need [.NET SDK 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

- In a terminal, go to `src/server/Voxta.Server`
- Execute `dotnet run`
